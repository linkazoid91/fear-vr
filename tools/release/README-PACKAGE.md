# F.E.A.R. VR – Overlay release

This archive is installed by extracting it **directly over an existing legal
F.E.A.R. 1.08 installation**. It adds a `FEARVR` folder, two launchers and
F.E.A.R. VR's own `dinput8.dll` and `d3d9.dll`; it does not replace `FEAR.exe`
or any retail archive. The DirectInput proxy fixes the original game's
accumulating HID slowdown. The D3D9 proxy activates the low-latency
asynchronous frame transport before the game creates its renderer.

If the game folder already contains a third-party `d3d9.dll`, preserve it
before extracting the archive. The development installer chains such a wrapper
as `d3d9.fearvr-upstream.dll`, but a plain ZIP extraction cannot back up a file
that it overwrites.

## Install and play

1. Extract the archive into the folder that contains `FEAR.exe`.
2. Start the headset runtime.
3. Double-click `Start F.E.A.R. VR.cmd`.

To force Valve's runtime, use
`Start F.E.A.R. VR - SteamVR.cmd`. The regular launcher uses the system's
active OpenXR runtime. Both launchers run the same 64-bit OpenXR host; SteamVR
is an OpenXR runtime and therefore does not require a separate renderer build.

The overlay keeps logs below `FEARVR\`. Saves, profiles and configuration use
the writable per-user directory
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\F.E.A.R. VR\userdata`; older data from `FEARVR\userdata` is
copied there once without overwriting newer files. This allows the retail game
to persist display settings even when Steam is installed below Program Files.
Updating is the same operation: extract the newer archive over the same game
folder.
The launcher retries a Steam app hand-off that produced no `FEAR.exe` and
then falls back to the verified executable directly while Steam remains
running. It only reports a successful start after the matching VR bridge has
loaded.
Startup diagnostics are written as `launcher-*.log` beside the host and proxy
logs for that run.

## Public and private archives

The normal release contains only redistributable F.E.A.R.-VR files. On its
first start it finds the owner's local **F.E.A.R. Public Tools 1.08**
installation and copies the five required runtime modules into `FEARVR`.
It checks registry entries and common folders on every local drive, including
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Sierra\FEAR Public Tools`. If nothing valid is found,
the visible launcher explicitly asks for the installation folder and verifies
the selected Public Tools 1.08 files before continuing.

If they are installed at a custom location:

```powershell
.\Start F.E.A.R. VR.cmd -PublicToolsGame "D:\FEAR Public Tools\Dev\Runtime\Game"
```

The official installer `fear_publictools_108.exe` is included with the Steam
Ultimate Shooter Edition under `extras\`. Its EULA does not grant permission
to redistribute the proprietary runtime modules.

A developer can create an immediately playable personal archive from a local
Public Tools installation:

```powershell
pwsh -File tools\make-release.ps1 -PrivateBundle
```

That private archive contains the proprietary modules, generated body assets
and the local x64 `d3dx10_43.dll` legacy DirectX redistributable required by
SteamVR's `vrmonitor.exe` on systems with an incomplete Steam prerequisite
installation. The DLL is exposed only through the SteamVR child-process path;
no file is copied into Windows or SteamVR. The archive is marked
`NOT FOR REDISTRIBUTION` and must not be published.

## Runtime selection

```powershell
.\Start F.E.A.R. VR.cmd -Runtime steamvr
.\Start F.E.A.R. VR.cmd -Runtime vdxr
.\Start F.E.A.R. VR.cmd -Runtime "D:\Runtime\manifest.json"
```

Runtime selection is process-local through `XR_RUNTIME_JSON`; no global OpenXR
setting is changed.

For `-Runtime steamvr`, the launcher checks the active OpenXR manifest,
Steam's registered install directory, every entry in
`steamapps\libraryfolders.vdf`, and SteamVR's app manifest. Steam and SteamVR
therefore do not need to be installed on `C:`. Supplying the complete manifest
path still works as shown above.

`Install.cmd` passes any extra arguments straight through, so
`Install.cmd -InstallDir "D:\Games\FearVR"` works the same way.

A copy under `steamapps\common` is launched through
`steam.exe -applaunch 21090`; any other copy is started directly with the
same arguments. `-LaunchMode` overrides that choice.

`-PublicToolsGame` accepts either the installation folder or its
`Dev\Runtime\Game` subfolder. Quote any path that contains spaces.

## Updating

Double-click `Install.cmd` in the new package. There is nothing to uninstall
first.

An existing installation is detected, the paths and launch mode from last
time are reused, the modules are replaced, and modules a newer package no
longer uses are removed. **Saved games and profiles stay.** Close the game
first — while `FEAR.exe` runs, its modules are locked and the installer
refuses to continue.

`-Clean` wipes the install folder except `userdata` before staging again.

## Playing

Desktop shortcut **F.E.A.R. VR**, or:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\play.ps1
```

Options:

```powershell
tools\play.ps1 -Runtime vdxr      # force Virtual Desktop
tools\play.ps1 -Runtime steamvr   # force SteamVR
tools\play.ps1 -Translation       # limited HMD translation (opt-in)
tools\play.ps1 -NoHeadBob         # force head bob off (already off by default)
tools\play.ps1 -NoStereoHud       # troubleshooting only
tools\play.ps1 -NoCapture         # raw Present-rate diagnosis; headset image off
tools\play.ps1 -NoHidFpsFix       # diagnostic rollback of the Jupiter EX HID fix
tools\play.ps1 -NoXrFramePacing   # allow duplicate XR requests for A/B testing
tools\play.ps1 -RenderScale 150   # supersample native stereo world rendering
```

`-Runtime` sets `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` for the host process only. The system-wide
runtime setting is never changed.

`-RenderScale` accepts 100 through 200 percent and applies only to native
stereo gameplay. Retail menus and videos keep their original backbuffer.
Start with 125 or 150 percent: classic-D3D9 CPU readback cost grows with the
number of pixels. The floating tool menu's VR tab can also change and persist
100/125/150/175/200 percent live. An explicit `-RenderScale` value overrides
that saved value for one launch.

During gameplay, hold both grips and press B to open the floating tuning
panel. Its Collide tab enables per-weapon world collision and adjusts the
equipped weapon's collision-box length, width, height, and forward offset.
The visible wireframe is green when clear and red while obstructed. See
`docs\WEAPON_COLLISION.md` for profile and configuration details.
The Move tab also shows the active eye height. Stand or sit in the intended
neutral posture and select **SET HEIGHT FROM HMD**; select the height row to
return to automatic session calibration. Floor-relative height is kept
separate from F9 horizontal/yaw recentering and from wall collision.
Set **MOVE DIRECTION: BODY** to look around without changing a held movement
direction. **HEAD** remains available as an explicit steering preference. A
small forward-axis corridor filters lateral thumb drift without removing
deliberate diagonal movement.

A Steam copy needs the Steam client running, because F.E.A.R. officially
starts through `steam.exe -applaunch 21090`. GOG and disc copies do not need
Steam at all. Either way this is independent of which VR runtime renders;
SteamVR itself does not have to run when using Virtual Desktop.

## Controls

- Right trigger fires the right-hand pistol.
- With a second pistol equipped, left trigger fires the left-hand pistol and
  X toggles slow motion. Otherwise X controls the selected light.
- Grip supports a two-handed weapon at its original foregrip location.
- The wrist HUD appears above the support wrist when its inner side is viewed.
- Lowering the headset crouches physically when `Physical duck` is enabled;
  stick crouch always remains available.
- VR options, including light placement, handedness and physical duck, are under
  `ESC > VR SETTINGS`.

Mouse, keyboard and gamepad remain usable in parallel.

Keyboard: **F8** stereo on/off, **F9** recenter the VR origin (and re-anchor a
visible 2D panel), **F10** world-locked comfort
screen, **F11** developer body-piece diagnostic.

## Removal

Delete the added `dinput8.dll`, `d3d9.dll`, `FEARVR` folder and the two
`Start F.E.A.R. VR*.cmd` launchers. Original retail files are not replaced, so
a Steam file verification is unnecessary.
